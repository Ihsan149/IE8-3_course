# IE803_Spring_2024
This course provides a comprehensive exploration of Applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the context of intelligent robotic systems. By engaging in theoretical lectures, practical exercises, and hands-on projects, students will acquire a comprehensive understanding of the integration of AI approaches in the development and functioning of robotic systems. The course curriculum includes a variety of topics, including machine learning approaches, computer vision, and other artificial intelligence techniques suited particularly for robotics. More precisely, we will explore several applications such as recognition, segmentation, classification, detection, and tracking. Following will be the example projects that will be taught in the class.
